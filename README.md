# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to help us gain a practical insight into the work done at KPMG and it is an opportunity for us to build career skills and experience.

# Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. The project is mainly divided into three tasks:

# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
**Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis** <br>
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets: <br>
1. Customer Demographic <br>
2. Customer Addresses <br>
3. Transactions data in the past 3 months <br>

We performed the preliminary data exploration and identified ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data. <br>
<br>
# Task 2: Data Insights <br>
**Targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.** <br>
1. In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation that outlined the approach that we will be taking. <br>
2. The client has agreed on a 3-week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation. <br>
3. Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting.<br>
# Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation <br>
**Using visualizations to present insights** <be>
<br>
Developed a dashboard using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business contexts when presenting findings were:<br>
<br>
1. What are the trends in the underlying data?<br>
2. Which customer segment has the highest customer value?<br>
3. What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing and growth strategy?<br>
4. What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?<br>
